// Discovery enables you to find your internet-connected ESP8266 devices on your network.
// When enabled, the ESP8266 will "ping" a server every 10 minutes, by default.
// Then, you can go to https://discover.evilgeniuslabs.org to view all of the 
// ESP8266 devices at your current location.

// Data submitted to the server: device name, local IP address, MAC address, and current millis (uptime).
// The server logs this, along with the public request IP address.
// When you visit https://discover.evilgeniuslabs.org, the server returns a list of devices
// with the same public request IP address.

// Discovery is "opt-in". It is disabled by default. Enable it if you want, if you find it useful.
// Evil Genius Labs, despite the name, is not actually evil, and will never sell or share
// this data to any 3rd parties, ever.

// This was a feature I needed for my own devices, of which there are dozens.  :)
